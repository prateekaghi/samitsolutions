# Password best practices

When your team is aware of password best practices, they can significantly ramp up your cybersecurity.

- Use a password manager

Using a password manager is important and can be the tool saving an organization from cybercriminals, a password manager is useful in creating strong passwords that can be unique for every login. This increases complexity and increases security.

- Implement single sign-on (SSO)

Single sign-on is a popular password solution that allows users to access multiple applications with one set of credentials. This means that you only need to remember one password to access all your online accounts.

While SSO is a convenient solution, remember that all your accounts are only as secure as your SSO password. So, if you’re using SSO, make a strong, unique password that you don’t use for anything else.

- Avoid reusing passwords on multiple accounts

If a hacker gains access to one of your accounts, they will try to use that same password to access your other accounts. By having different passwords for different accounts, you can limit the damage that a hacker can cause.

However, avoid jotting down your passwords on a piece of paper and instead depend on a safe solution like using a reliable password manager.

- Make use of two-factor authentication (2FA)

One of the best ways to protect your online accounts is to use two-factor authentication (2FA). In addition to your password, 2FA requires you to enter a code from your phone or another device. Even if someone knows your password, this method makes it much more difficult for them to hack into your account.

Setting up 2 FA is an easy way and an authenticator app like Google or Microsoft Authenticator

- Don’t use the information available on your social media

Many people use social media to connect with friends and family, stay up to date on current events, or share their thoughts and experiences with others. However, social media can also be a source of valuable personal information for criminals.

When creating passwords, you must avoid using information easily obtainable on your social media accounts. This includes your name, birth date, and other details that could be used to guess your password. By taking this precaution, you can help keep your accounts safe and secure.
