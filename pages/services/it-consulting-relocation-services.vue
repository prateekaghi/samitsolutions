To use VoIP technology, you only need an Internet connection, sound card, speakers, microphone, and low-cost software. With VoIP phone technology we can help you cut the cost of your phone system, while adding many useful features. We can help you integrate your phone system with other applications like e-mail or customer database, so next time you get a call from a customer, your computer system can have all the information ready. Also, with VoIP you can set up a conference room, with your entire team having a conversation in real time. You can also call abroad anywhere, get contact lists, login to your VoIP account remotely and much more!",
